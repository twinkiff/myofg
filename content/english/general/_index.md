Note that this website assume you have a basic knowledge and familiarity about the gear you are willing to make. For instance, for latex, it assumes you already own a few pieces and are already familiar with topics such as wearing latex clothes, taking care of them, etc. If this is not your case, first familiarize yourself with the fabric/gear and its constraints and requirements. There are plenty of resources online to cover this, be it on vendor's websites or through community-run spaces. Also, do reach out to people on social medias or drop by a local fetish event as they will be full of resources and tips!
