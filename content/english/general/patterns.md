# Printing patterns

PDF sewing patterns are a convenient way to access a wide range of designs from independent and commercial designers alike. You will find plenty of patterns online, which are ready to print at home. However, to ensure your final garment turns out as expected, it's essential to print the pattern accurately. This guide walks you through the key steps to print to scale and assemble your pattern correctly.

## 1. Open the file in your PDF reader

First, download the pattern file to your computer and open it using your preferred PDF reader, such as **Adobe Acrobat Reader** (Mac and Windows) or **Okular** (Linux). Avoid printing from your web browser or other PDF viewers, unless you know what you are doing, as they can sometimes distort the scale.

## 2. Check Printer Settings

Before printing the full pattern, locate the **test square** — usually found on the first or second page of the file. It's commonly marked as 1" x 1" (or 4 cm x 4 cm).

Then, print a test page using the recommended printer settings:
- **Page Size:** Select **Actual Size** or set scaling to **100%**
- **Page Scaling:** Set to **None**
- **Orientation:** Typically **Portrait**, unless otherwise noted
- **Paper Size:** Use **Letter** or **A4**. Some patterns are provided in Letter size, which is slightly smaller than A4. You can print them on A4 but will have quite a few paper loss.

Measure the test square with a ruler, and confirm that it’s accurate. If the square is off, double-check your printer settings before proceeding.

## 3. Print the Full Pattern

Once you're confident the scale is correct, go ahead and print the rest of the pattern. Most designers provide a page layout or map to help you print only the pages you need (for your size or view).

- Make sure no edges are being cut off — this often happens if “Fit to Page” is mistakenly selected.
- Allow all pages to dry if you're using an inkjet printer to avoid smudging.

## 4. Assemble the Pages

Each page will include guides to help you piece the pattern together, such as:

- **Trim lines** or **scissors icons** showing where to cut
- **Overlap markers** or **registration lines** to match up
- **Page numbers or grid letters** that indicate the row and column

For an easier assembly:
- Trim the top and left margins (or as directed) so pages can overlap cleanly.
- Align the guides precisely and tape or glue the pages together.
- Work row by row or column by column for consistency.
- Use a hard, flat surface like a table or cutting mat to keep things aligned.

## 5. Cutting and Storing Your Pattern

After your pattern is assembled:

- Either cut your size directly from the taped sheets (usually the easiest solution for print at home patterns), or
- Trace your size onto pattern paper to preserve the original for future use.

To store, fold the assembled pattern neatly.
