# Getting started with latex gear

<!-- TODO: Add images -->

## Let's make your first tank top!

A tank top is one of the simplest piece you can think of when it comes to latex gear-making. It consists of only 2 pattern pieces (and 4 seams in total). The fit is quite easy to get right (and rather forgiving if you don't have an exact fit, meaning you will likely be able to wear your first piece anyways :) and opens to a full world of variations when it comes to adjusting fit, colors or edge binding.

### Requirements

Here is a list of all the base tools you need to follow this guide. This is the minimal equipment required to sew your latex. For a list of shops where you can source them, head over to the [shops section](./shops.md).

You will need:

A cutting mat (30 €)
: A cutting mat will greatly help you to cut your pattern onto latex. Ideally, you want one large enough to fit any pattern pieces (A1 or more is the most comfortable) and dedicated exclusively to your latex gear making so that you can have glue overflow on it without worrying.
: Usually, the best and cheapest option is to look online on websites such as Amazon. If on a budget, you can also look in discount stores such as Action or Costco, where you can find very cheap and rather decent cutting mats.
: Last resort solution is to use any kitchen cutting mat in plastic, but this will greatly reduce the lifespan of your cutting wheel.

A cutting wheel/rotary cutter (10 €)
: Think of it as a pizza slicing tool. It lets you cut fabric with precision and speed and especially for very stretch material such as latex.
: If you don't have any, you might use (sharp!) scissors at the expense of more painful pattern cutting.


Some thinner or similar solvent and cloth (10 €)
: You need a thinner/solvent to clean and degrease the surface of latex to prep it for the glue. Thinner also slightly dissolves latex and makes the surface slightly smoother.
: You can use many different products to achieve this goal: acetone, ecological thinner, synthetic thinner. They are more or less efficient and more or less harmful (usually the less harmful, the less efficient) and while you might have some success with acetone, synthetic thinner is one of the best means to degrease and roughen up latex prior to gluing. It can be found together with paints in any hardware store and is mainly made of isobutanol/xylene/toluene which sadly also makes it extremely harmful. Given these are highly volatile, remember to always close the bottle lids when you are not actively using the solvent (open the lid, put some on your cloth, close lid).
: {{% hint danger %}}Thinner and toluene-based products are really harmful, and this cannot be emphasized enough. You should wear adequate protective equipment (gloves, goggles and mask, see below) and manipulate it outside (or in a **very well** ventilated area as it is highly volatile and even a few milliliters can spread across your whole house). It is highly volatile and very flammable which means you should dispose of it in empty and clean containers to drop at your nearby recycling point, and never throw it in the sink. If you don't trust us, trust <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toluene#Toxicology_and_metabolism">Wikipedia</a>.<br/>If you experience any dizziness or symptom, go get fresh air outside. In case of eye contact, rinse thoroughly for tens of minutes with clean water. Exposure temporary symptoms (which you should not get if using adequate protective equipment) can include loss of sensibility in the fingers or loss of taste. If you think you have been exposed and have symptoms, go to a doctor.

Gas mask (50 €) and protective glasses (5 €)/
: As outlined before, you will need some protective equipment and in particular a gas mask (real one, not the kinky one under your bed) and protective glasses (to avoid projections, and believe us they **do** occur even if you'd think they don't). Any protective glasses from your nearby hardware store will do. For the gas mask, however, you'll want some serious.
: With your gas mask on and if your filter/cartridge is still fresh, you should not smell any strong smell from thinner/solvent (it is highly volatile and smells very strong, so if you can smell it through your gas mask, then the gas mask is up to no good!). While you might have learned about FFP2/FFP3 during covid, these are only protection scores for particles and we are interested in chemicals here. You are aiming for a painting/chemical gas mask.
: These are usually labelled AxPy with x the score for the protection on chemicals (higher is better, means more ppm capacity) and y the score for particle filtering efficiency (high is better, similar to FFP2 / FFP3). You want a cartridge protecting against "Organic Vapors" (see [this guide from 3M](https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/639110O/respirator-selection-guide.pdf)).
: A reference such as 3M 6002C should be fine for hobbyist use and proper care taken.
: {{% hint warning %}}The gas mask is some proper and serious protective equipment and you don't want to get anything cheap off Amazon missing any certification or security warranty. Go with a safe and well established brand such as 3M.{{% /hint %}}

Gloves (10 €)
: Part of the basic and essential protective equipement are gloves. For obvious reasons, avoid latex gloves as the solvent will dissolve them the same as the latex you are trying to sew. When buying gloves (especially online), **double check the material they are made of** since it is not always obviously stated.
: Disposable nitrile gloves (the ones from your nearby hardware store) are a basic and short term solution. A regular disposable nitrile glove should be fine for works up to a few minutes as long as it is only for splash protection and not in direct contact with toluene. See [this university fact sheet](https://ehrs.upenn.edu/health-safety/lab-safety/chemical-hygiene-plan/fact-sheets/fact-sheet-disposable-nitrile-gloves) for more details.
: If you are getting serious about latex gear making, invest in some high protective gloves for chemicals (about 50€). It can be thicker nitrile gloves (the thicker the glove, the more resistant it is) or butyl gloves. You might find some in local latex shops (e.g. [Gear](https://gearberlin.com/) or [Blackstyle](https://www.blackstyle.de/) if you are based in Berlin). In terms of norms, you are looking for an [EN 374](https://www.mapa-pro.com/standards/standard-en-374-chemical) exhibiting Type A or B (more than 30 minutes breakthrough time) against chemical F (Toluene). Such a glove is reusable (up to a theroretical total time of 30 minutes contact with toluene). This is easier to check in the manufacturer's datasheets or with the markings on the gloves, e.g. [this pair of gloves](https://www.ultimateindustrial.co.uk/hand-and-arm/chemical-protection/ketodex/) (and their [datasheet](https://www.ultimateindustrial.co.uk/Assets/Downloads/DS-Ketodex.pdf)).

Some latex glue and a brush (15 €)
: The latex glue is a vulcanizing glue. It works the same way as repair patches on your bike tires. It is basically made of raw latex dissolved in a solvent (e.g. toluene, see above) and vulcanizing agents. It will slightly dissolve latex when applied and the main trick for gluing and maximizing the creation of bonds is to apply pressure on the two pieces of latex. Given it is made of solvent, it is also highly flammable and quite toxic.
: The glue usually comes in tins and is available in various sizes. If you are new to latex gear making (otherwise, you know about your expected consumption), head for the smallest tins (usually 100mL or 150mL) as this will be more than enough to make your first gears. The glue should have a lifetime of about 6 months (solvent will evaporate when you use it and it will be less liquid and easy to apply afterwards), and you can somehow slightly revive it by adding a bit of thinner to dilute it. As the glue is highly volatile, remember to always close the lid when you are not using it, to preserve it.
: A good starting glue is the [Eurocatsuits](https://www.eurocatsuits.com/latex-glue.php?la=en&currency=EUR) glue.
{{% hint info %}}
The vulcanizing glue will only be useful to bonding latex to latex. If you are considering adding zippers (which will be regular fabric, e.g. polyester or cotton), you will need another glue for them (called "zipper glue" on latex supplies websites).

A pressing roller (4 €)
: As we will detail later, gluing latex together is not done that much by the glue drying (as you would stick two pieces of paper) but by the glue slightly dissolving the latex fabric and creating bonds between the two sheets of latex. Therefore, to make a strong bond, you need to firmly press the seam, and the best tool to do so is a pressing roller. It comes in different lengths and different firmness and finishes. For your first projects, any roller will be fine. [Here](https://www.latexrepair.nl/en/Pressure-roller,-firm-rubber-4-cm) is an example of such a roller, but you can find many alternatives with the keyword "pressure roller" online.

Some talc powder (2 €)
: Talc is useful for clearing extra glue and trying quickly your latex gear without resorting to silicon oil. Head over to your closest supermarket and look for talc powder in the baby area :)

and of course… some latex (and trims for the finishes)! All the details on the latex itself are in the dedicated [shops section](./shops.md).


### Finding your pattern and the correct size

First, read the [general instructions on printing patterns](../general/patterns.md). Then, you have multiple pattern options:
* You might be a total beginner, in which case we would recommend using a commercially available sewing pattern to make your first tank top. The (free) [Arrowsmith tank top](https://threadtheory.ca/products/arrowsmith) is a good pattern for your first piece.
* You might already have a tank top that fits you well (either latex or fabric) and you might want to reproduce it. Then, head over to the [latex patterns section](./patterns.md) for useful tips.
* You might already be a sewing hobbyist/expert and you might want to draft your own pattern. Then, have fun and just beware that Latex seams are overlapping and not sewn as usual (see the details in the [latex patterns section](./patterns.md)).

When it comes to sizing, you will need a measurement tape (or anything else which you can use to measure yourself) and take your measurements (chest and waist). If using a standard pattern, then look for the size closest to your body measurements (aim for slightly smaller if you are in between two pattern sizes). As most patterns you will find are for regular fabric (cotton, polyester, etc.), they will likely feature some ease as these fabrics are usually not as stretch nor as compressive as latex. With latex clothing, you will likely aim for a more compressive fit, which often results in going one size down. Most patterns will also list the _final garments measurements_ (besides body measurements) and these are extremely useful to pick the right size. Also beware that sewing requires extra allowances than overlapping and gluing latex.

**TODO** Illustration of sewing allowances

In case of doubt, and for your first garment, it is better to go for one size slightly larger. Indeed, it is quite easy to cut the seams open, remove a few cm fabric on each side (with a rotary cutter) and glue again to get a tighter fit, but if the garment is too small you won't be able to enlarge it!

{{% hint info %}}
Rule of thumb (but no rule is exact and it is mandatory to test on your body!) is that you can reduce the horizontal measurements (not vertical, or your garment will be too short!) of any tight fitting regular fabric (sewing) pattern by 10% when doing it with latex to account for the stretch of the material. However, beware that too tight latex can cut blood flow and if you are aiming for the perfect fit, do [test it carefully before wearing for extensive periods](./index.md).

If the final size is not provided by the pattern, you will have to size down yourself the pattern. It works the same way whether you are doing latex or regular sewing, so head over to the [guide](../sportswear/sizing.md).

Here is a detailed example for the [Arrowsmith tank top pattern](https://threadtheory.ca/products/arrowsmith) comes with a detailed [size chart](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0371/0101/files/Pattern-info-AT.jpg?v=1652381943). Let us assume you measured your chest and got 100cm as a tight measurement on your body:
* It is said to come in 3/8" (1cm) sewing allowance. When gluing latex you will rather have a 0.5cm overlap, which means that you will have a total of 1.5 extra centimer per seam (0.5cm from the smaller seam and 1cm coming from overlap vs regular sewing seam). There are two seams around the chest (a left and a right seam), meaning that you should add 3 cm to the provided garment chest size.
* Size M is said to be for 99.1cm chest measurement and would match on paper your chest measurements **if done with regular fabric**. However, given the previous point, it will actually result in a 49 + 49 + 3 = 101cm final chest size for the latex garment, which will be too large!
* Size S on the other hand would result in a 46.5 + 46.5 + 3 = 96cm final chest size. This should be a safe basis for your first latex garment!


### Print and cut your pattern

Once you have determined your pattern size, [print and cut the correct size](../general/patterns.md). Lay your latex flat on your cutting mat. Place the pattern pieces on it, and add some weights (e.g. [30-40mm metal discs that you will find in any hardware store](https://www.amazon.fr/Pi%C3%A8ces-Rondelles-Rondelle-Inoxydable-Boulons/dp/B0D8J8BW9F)). Symmetric patterns such as tee-shirts/tank tops usually feature a "cut on fold" line, meaning you get the symmetry by folding the fabric and aligning and cutting on the fold. This is however not the most practical solution when cutting latex and the easiest fix for this is to print these pattern pieces twice and simply scotch them together to restore the full shape. You can then cut on a flat fabric (no fold) with the cutting wheel.

{{% hint info %}}
When using a regular fabric pattern (for sewing e.g. cotton or polyester), you will see some notions of "bias" or "grain line". This is because regular fabric as a preferred direction (the weaving is not the same in any direction and some directions have more stretch or are stronger than others). Latex fabric is perfectly isotropic so you don't have to worry about aligning in any specific direction. This also makes it easier to optimally pack the various pattern pieces to reduce the wastes!

You can slightly extend your latex by hand in the perpendicular direction to your cutting direction, to make cutting slightly easier.

{{% hint info %}}
Your latex fabric will usually feature a slightly smoother and shinier face than the other. You will likely this one to be facing outside, which means you should be cautious about which side is up when you cut your pattern. However, for this specific pattern, the tank top is a perfectly symmetric piece, so you don't have to worry about which side goes up!
