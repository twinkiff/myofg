**Before going further, an important word of caution**:

Most latex clothes look best when they are worn tight, meaning you will likely try to adapt the patterns to get the closest fit to your body. Tight is fine but too tight can become dangerous, since too tight latex can cut blood flow.

Therefore, when making new clothes, always try them in a calm place and wear them for a few hours to ensure everything is fine and you are fully comfortable with them before going out to party!
