# Learn to sew!

## How to learn to sew?

* References to start sewing TODO
* Start with something simple, basic pouch bags, regular cotton fabric.
* Drop by your nearest fabric shop, they probably have some mentoring. Ask your grandma ;)


## Requirements

See Shops page!

* Cutting mat
* Cutting wheel
* Sewing machine and needles
* Fabric


## First MYOG project: card sleeve

* Pattern is free
* Not very kinky, but will get you used with sewing these fabrics.
* Small project size means you can get any fabric scraps to do it.
